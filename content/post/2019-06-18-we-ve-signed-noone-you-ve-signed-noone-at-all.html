<p>Melbourne City have an odd connection with Bolton Wanderers, with Aaron Mooy, Scott Jamieson, Luke Brattan, ex coach Warren Joyce and now <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/melbourne-city-sign-craig-noone-from-bolton-wanderers/news-story/3e1d9317ca8a0626a7a736ec34940680">Craig Noone</a> have been involved for both clubs.</p>
<p>Noone is a fair bit different to most of the Wingers that Melbourne City posseses (and plays a little bit counter to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Football_Group#The_City_Way">“City Way”</a>)</p>
